# How to install, i think

## first, have MCPI-reborn-revival-docker installed.
```bash
# then download the world from the facebook marketplace
wget https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/mcpi-repo/blob/main/worlds/VoidWorld/VoidWorld.zip?raw=true
cd /home/$USER/.minecraft-pi/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds
unzip 'VoidWorld.zip?raw=true'

```
## Then start mcpi and open the world, probably at the very end of the list
```bash
# then download all the scripts to the working directory, and run them
pip3 install mcpi #install the python thing if u lack it currently
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beiop/attempts-to-understand-mcpi/main/python%20scripts/9min(3).mp3"
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beiop/attempts-to-understand-mcpi/main/python%20scripts/rave.py"
```
## run thingy
```
python3 rave.py
```
